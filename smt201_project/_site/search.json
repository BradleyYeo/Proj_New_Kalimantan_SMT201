Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and forest fires can be very destructive and the capital should be located far away from these areas. To reduce costs of building infrastructure and speed up the construction process, the area selected should avoid steep slopes and have relatively flat ground.\nAs the new capital, the city should be located near other regions with an active labour force so as to recruit talent to build the city. Hence, it is important to locate the city near urban settlements like Balikpapan and Samarinda. As many construction materials will be needed to build the capital, it needs to have high accessibility via roads. Building an airport takes several years, but with sufficient land and capital, it is possible to do so, as such being close to an airport is not as important as the other factors.\nWhy Muara Badak?\n We recommend the new capital to be located in Sungai (River) Bawang and Badak Mekar inside the Muara Badak district in the Kutai Kartanegara regency of East Kalimantan Province. The selected sites are far from areas prone to natural disasters, near a water source and have flat land ideal for building a city.\nThe combined land area of Sungai Bawang and Badak Mekar is 5,021 hectares. It is accessible via road transport to the North Penajam Paser Utara Regency and a 1.5 hour drive to the major cities of Samarinda. The area is also a 3 hour drive to the Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman International Airport and the Seaport of Balikpapan. It has little natural forest area and as such it is less prone to forest fires.\nGithub Repository\n\nSungai (River) Bawang and Badak Mekar\n\n\n\n\n",

Given the excessive number of vehicles on congested roads, this has not only polluted the air, but also decreased the productivity of the nation as people spend a large amount of time idling in traffic.With that in mind, Indonesia is going to relocate its new capital from Jakarta to a new city in East Kalimantan, Borneo.\n3 Motivation\nDespite Kalimantan being four times bigger than Java, it is concerning that it accounts for less than a tenth of the gross domestic production. With Java accounting for 60% of the country’s population and more than 50% of economic activity, the shift of the country’s capital to Kalimantan is inevitable.\nThe beauty of the chosen Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara Municipality in East Kalimantan is that it (1) has a lower exposure to natural disaster (2) geographically located at the centre of Indonesia and (3) has more space than Jarkarta to create new opportunities for migrants from other parts of Indonesia. All in all, this strategic shift will address the issue of inequality and relieve the burden on Jakarta.\n4 Objective\nWe aim to recommend a new capital city for Indonesia based on the geospatial characteristics of the location.\nIn this project we will be studying the following areas:\nPopulation and Demographics\nEconomy\nTransport and Communication\nInfrastructure\nEnvironment and Hazards\n5 Data Sources\n6 Scope of Work\nAshlyn Yip\nPoster\nPopulation and Demographics Map\nTransport and Communication (Buildings) Map\nBradley Yeo Kian\nWebsite\nGDP Map\nRoads, Seaport and Airport Map\nCrissie Tan\nProject Artifact\nEnvironmental Hazards Map\nDEM Map\n7 Project Schedule in Gantt Chart\n\nProject Schedule\n\n\n\n\n",

Given the large amount of land Indonesia has, the production of rubber, fruits, oil palm, wood fiber/timber shows that Indonesia is reliant on agriculture and that it is a huge contributor to Indonesia’s economy (Iswara, n.d.).\n3 Transport and Communication\n3.1 Seaport\n We have 12 seaports strategically located in our study area. All seaports are either near (1) major rivers or (2) coastlines. We can see that the centers of Balikpapan and Samarinda are near seaports. This emphasizes Balikpapan’s position as a seaport city where the exporting of their natural resources happens. According to our environmental study, it shows how resource rich our study area is, especially for products such as oil, rubber and timber.\n3.2 Roads\n According to the order of importance based on OpenStreetMap’s Wikipage, we have motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary, residential, motorway_link, trunk_link, primary_link, secondary_link, tertiary_link.\nGiven that both Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda are our two urban areas, this is heavily reflected on the map where they are densely populated with roads.\nThe trunk road (orange) is the second most important road after the motorway. The trunk roads in central Kota Samarinda diverge, and paves its way to the two other regencies, Kutai Kartanegara, Kota Balikpapan, but not Penajam Paser Utara. There exists one unlinked trunk road in Penajam Paser Utara which would make transport to our two urban areas hard.\nInstead of reliance on the trunk roads, the primary roads (blue) in the central Kota Samarinda diverge, and pave its way to the three other regencies, Kutai Kartanegara, Kota Balikpapan, and Penajam Paser Utara. This is reflected in central Kota Balikpapan as well, as it paves its way to the three other regencies, Penajam Paser Utara, Kutai Kartanegara, and Kota Samarinda.\nThus, all four regencies are accessible to each other via the primary roads.\n4 Infrastructure\n4.1 Electricity and Power Substations\n East Kalimantan is one of the largest producers of coal in Indonesia and yet, it still needs to import coal for local needs. Coal is an important source of fuel for electricity in Indonesia. Furthermore, it contributes significantly to Indonesia’s GDP. As Indonesia is trying to stop relying on imported coal, the majority of power substations in the central region of Samarinda is encouraging. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the land area of Samarinda is an urban settlement area.\nWhen analyzing the distribution of substations and electrical lines we can overlay this map with earthquake prone areas to understand where electrical lines should be built. In areas prone to earthquakes, electrical lines should be above ground to reduce the costs of repairing them if they are damaged. In areas with a low probability of earthquakes, electrical lines can be underground.\n4.2 Water Supply\n\nAs streams and rivers are both sources of clean water (Puteri & Budianto, 2020), it is essential that we analyse our major rivers in the study area. We also looked into various Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM), a state-owned business which distributes clean water to the general public.\nWe observed that PDAMs are strategically located along the major rivers. Since most PDAMs are at the central of Kutai Kartanegara and Kota Samarinda, adequate clean water provision and high sanitation levels are likely near those areas.\n5 Environment and Hazard\n5.1 Slope Analysis\n Using the Hillshade and DEM layer, we can identify places that have very steep slopes and are not ideal for capital building: 1. Kutai Kartanegara: Sepakat, 2. Penajam Paser Utara: Sepaku , Bumi Harapan, Riko In our map, the slopes that are in blue are very steep, which are not ideal for our site selection.\n5.2 Forested Area and Forest Fires\n From this map, we can see that the East Kutai regency has the historically highest severity of Forest fires. Further down, the Kutai Kartanegara regency also experiences a high amount of forest fires. However, there are still parts of East Kalimantan relatively unscathed by forest fires like Balikpapan and the North Penajam Paser Regency.\n5.3 Sediment Distribution\n In this Geology layer, we identify that there exists 5 different types of sediments: Alluvium, Daystone, Mudstone, Flish, Limestone, Sandstone. The finer the sediment grains, the easier the transportation process of the sediment moving in waters and therefore easier to build a new capital on top of the land because of the smaller amount of bumps and grind occurred. Sites such as the coastline of Kutai Kartanegara near water tend to have alluvium, a type of loose soil that has been eroded and carried in suspension by flood or river water before being deposited (Design Buildings, 2021). Ground conditions are poor, and it is not ideal for city building. Sites in Penajam Paser Utara and North Kutai Kartanegara have sandstone which is mainly sand residues that are very porous. Sandstone has been known to be resistant to weathering issues and often used in constructing buildings. Furthermore, because sandstone is porous, it is effective in separating pollutants from contaminated water to produce safe and clean water.\n\n\n\n",
