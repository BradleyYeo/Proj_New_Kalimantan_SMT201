The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan. Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and forest fires can be very destructive and the capital should be located far away from these areas. To reduce costs of building infrastructure and speed up the construction process, the area selected should avoid steep slopes and have relatively flat ground.

As the new capital, the city should be located near other regions with an active labour force so as to recruit talent to build the city. Hence, it is important to locate the city near urban settlements like Balikpapan and Samarinda. As many construction materials will be needed to build the capital, it needs to have high accessibility via roads.  Building an airport takes several years, but with sufficient land and capital, it is possible to do so, as such being close to an airport is not as important as the other factors.


## Why Muara Badak?

![](img/FINAL_SITE.png)
We recommend the new capital to be located in **Sungai (River) Bawang** and **Badak Mekar** inside the **Muara Badak district** in the Kutai Kartanegara regency of East Kalimantan Province. The selected sites are far from areas prone to natural disasters, near a water source and have flat land ideal for building a city.

The combined land area of Sungai Bawang and Badak Mekar is  5,021 hectares. It is accessible via road transport to the North Penajam Paser Utara Regency and a 1.5 hour drive to the major cities of Samarinda. The area is also a 3 hour drive to the Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman International Airport and the Seaport of Balikpapan. It has little natural forest area and as such it is less prone to forest fires.
