## Problem:
> Indonesia needs to relocate the new capital from Jakarta to a city in East Kalimantan, Borneo.

## Motivation 
1. Leverage GIS skills to  analyse a *large land area*.
2. *Learn Bahasa Indonesia* to translate fields into English.
3. Integrate *dirty* and *missing data* from *multiple sources*.

## Approach:
1. Raster Distance
2. Raster to Vector
3. Binary Analysis
4. Proximity Analysis
5. Accessibility to Seaports and Airports
6. GIS-Based Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis
7. Choropleth Maps
8. Site-Suitability Map
9. Digital Elevation Model Map
10.
11.
12.


## Results 
![Economically Active Group](img/economically_active_group.png){.main_pic}
- Labour force is concentrated in **East Kutai Regency** and **Balikbapan**
![Seaport Locations](img/Seaport_River.png){.main_pic}
- Seaports are near **Balikbapan**, **Samarinda** and, **Kutai Kartanegara Regency**

## Future Work 
1. Proportional Symbol map of **high GDP growth areas** after capital has been relocated.
2. Proportional Symbol map showing **carbon emissions** by region or city.
3. Choropleth map showing **infant mortality rate** as it is one of the best indicators of the livability of a city.
